_SideExpect_ is a Sinatra program for Flatiron School. Users can find their medicines, view common side effects, add side effects, and more. This information is intended to support patients as they go through treatment for conditions such as cancer, immune diseases, and more that sometimes have cloudy predictability when it comes to side-effects that _real_ people _really_ experience. Parents may also find this tool useful to see what effects certain medications may commonly have for their children. Doctors may also find this tool useful to see what side effects are commonly reported along with medications they might prescribe. It is intended to be a crowd-sourced tool, and not for diagnosis, treatment, or medical use. Any medications taken should always be done under the consult of a doctor; all side effects should also be reported to a medical professional.
